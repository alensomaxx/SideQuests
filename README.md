# 🧩 SideQuests

Welcome to **SideQuests** — a living collection of creative, bite-sized code experiments, utilities, and curiosities!  
Think of this as my personal lab where I explore, tinker, and occasionally build things that are small but mighty.

## 🌟 What is *SideQuests*?

Much like in games, **SideQuests** are those fun detours — small but meaningful.  
This repository is home to:

- ⚙️ **Mini Tools** — Handy scripts that solve real-world problems.
- 🧠 **Learning Experiments** — Trying out new libraries, concepts, or algorithms.
- 🎮 **Tiny Games or UI Demos** — Interactive projects like [TicTacToe](https://github.com/alensomaxx/SideQuests/releases).
- 💡 **Creative Code Snippets** — Fun, odd, or clever Python pieces that deserve their own spotlight.

Whether it's just a few lines of code or a compact app, each "quest" here has its own personality.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

As a developer, I constantly find myself exploring weird, wonderful, or just plain useful side ideas.  
Instead of letting them collect dust, I'm sharing them here — polished or not — for others to learn from, use, or contribute to.

> _“Not everything needs to be a startup. Sometimes, it’s just a cool little project.”_
